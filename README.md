As part of the E-commerce project, I implemented a background image slider to enhance user engagement on the homepage.

A large collection of images is available in the background.

The slider displays 3 images at a time:

One previous image (center - 1)

The current (center) image

One next image (center + 1)

Users can navigate using "Previous" and "Next" buttons.

On each navigation, only the visible 3 images are updated in the UI â€” improving performance and maintaining a clean layout.
